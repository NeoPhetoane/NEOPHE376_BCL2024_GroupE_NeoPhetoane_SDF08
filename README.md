Comments
This project utilises css frameworks mostly focuses on creating classes to link html elements to css and JavaScript. Flexbox and grid are used to organise and place images and text where they are desired to be. A hamburger menu is also used to navigate through the page, and to navigate to your project using pictures, a link is created. Media queries make the site responsive

Areas of improvement
An area that I am not so confident in, is placing images properly using flexbox. The image in the "Who I am section" could not go directly under the title but is to the right more than it should be.


Mastery points
I am comfortable with usinng grid to have content layed out on a page the way I wish. I am able to define color for future use and I am also able to use margin and padding for spacing. Media queries to accomodate different screens, I am also able to do with ease.
